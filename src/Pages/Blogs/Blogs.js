                        Difference between javascript and jodejs: JavaScript is a simple programming language that runs in any browser JavaScript Engine. Whereas Node JS is an interpreter or running environment for a JavaScript programming language that holds many excesses, it requires libraries that can easily be accessed from JavaScript programming for better use.

                                     <li>JavaScript is programming language. It running in any web browser with proper browser Engine.</li>
                                     <li>Mainly using for any client side activity for a web application, like possible attribute validation or refeshing the page in a specific interval or provide some dynamic changes in web pages without refreshing the page.</li>

                        Node.js is an open source server environment which uses JavaScript on the server to develop backend applications.MongoDB is undoubtedly one of the most popular NoSQL database choices today. And it has a great community and ecosystem.

                                 <strong>When use Nodejs: </strong>
                                 Any project needs a programming environment and a runtime library that offers you basic programming tools/support and can compile and/or interpret your code. Nodejs is such as tool for the Javascript programming language. There are other similar tools for other languages such as Python, Java, PHP, C#, C++, Go, etc...
                                 So, if you want to write some kind of stand-alone program or server in Javascript, then you can use nodejs for it.

                                 <strong>When use MongoDB:</strong>
                                 If your application needs the ability to persistently store data in a way that you can efficiently query or update it later, then you would typically use some form of database. There are dozens of popular databases. MongoDB is one such database. MariaDB, MySql, CouchDB, DynamoDB (on AWS), Postgres are examples of other databases. Different databases have different strengths (things they are best at) and different ways of using them so it's a whole different question to choose the right/best database for what you're doing.

                        SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or json.

                                 JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties — a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
                             </div>
                             <div>
                                 Typically, a private key, or secret, is used by the issuer to sign the JWT. The receiver of the JWT will verify the signature to ensure that the token hasn’t been altered after it was signed by the issuer. It is difficult for unauthenticated sources to guess the signing key and attempt to change the claims within the JWT.
                             </div>

                                 When it comes to APIs, JWTs are the standard. They offer a compact and safe method of information exchange without the need for a centralized token database.
 
                                 Now that you have answers to what is JWT? and what are tokens?, you can create more secure APIs.
